## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to analyze how the job market responds to different crises and the long-term trend of the job market. In order to analyze the response, the project focuses on the change of unemployment over time and during the 2 periods.

## Project Description
This Project is based on R. The project uses 1 dataset of monthly civilian unemployment rates from 1990 to 2025. Includes introduction, data cleaning and modification, data visualization, summary stats, and conclusion. The project specifically focuses on the unemployment rate during the Great Recession (2006-2014) and the COVID-19 pandemic (2019-2024). The data has been modified, transformed into central tendencies, and visualized in line plots. The two periods are compared, and the project includes the identification of patterns in unemployment spikes and recoveries. The finding of the project is unemployment rate rises and falls in a cyclical pattern, but each cycle would perform differently based on different geopolitical and financial factors during the period.
