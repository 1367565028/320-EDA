# Description
This is an EDA notebook project focusing on the Unemployment rate in the US. We used central tendencies and line plots to quantify the unemployment in years for overall and in month for the Great Recession and Covid-19 periods.

## Goal
We want the project to be useful for understanding how the job market responds to different crises over a specific period.
